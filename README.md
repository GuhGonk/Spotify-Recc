# Description
Recently, Spotify's individual song reccomendations have not been up to par, oftentimes reccomending previously played songs in the autoplay reccomender. This project aims to provide a service that reccomend "similar" songs based on genre and Spotify API's audio features (tempo, key, "energy", etc.).

Spotify utilizes a combination of collaborative and content based filtering to produce music reccomendations for its users. Collaborative filtering utilizes data from the user's profile (tastes, genres, habits, etc.) and combines it with other user's data to produce playlists based on shared points. Content based filtering compares individual items to other items, in this case, song to song.
